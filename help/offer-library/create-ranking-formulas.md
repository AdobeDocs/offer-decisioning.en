# Create ranking formulas {#create-ranking-formulas}

**Ranking formulas** are rules that determine which offer should be presented first for a given placement, rather than taking into account the offers' priority scores.

Once a ranking formula has been created, you can assign it to a placement in an offer activity. For more on this, refer to [this section](../offer-activities/configure-offer-selection.md).

To create a ranking formula, follow the steps below:

* Access the **[!UICONTROL Activities]** menu, then the **[!UICONTROL ranking formulas]** tab.

* All created ranking formulas display here. Click **[!UICONTROL Create formula]** to create a new ranking formula.
