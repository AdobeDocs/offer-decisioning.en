# Creating fallback offers {#creating-fallback-offers}

The fallback offer is sent to customers if they are not eligible for other offers. The steps to create a fallback offer consist in creating one or several representations, like when creating an offer.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Creating a fallback offer is mandatory as it is required to use an offer activity in Campaign Standard.

To create a fallback offer, follow these steps:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Inventory]** tab, select the **[!UICONTROL Fallback Offers]** section, then click **[!UICONTROL Create Fallback Offer]**.

1. Create one or several representations for the fallback offer. To do this, drag and drop placements from the left pane, like when creating an offer. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-placements.md).

>Fallback offers have no eligibility rules and constraint parameters, as they will be presented as last resorts with no condition.
