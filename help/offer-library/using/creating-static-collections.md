# Managing offers collections {#managing-offers-collections}

Collections allows you to organize your offers by regrouping them into categories of your choice.

When an offer activity is inserted into a Campaign delivery, you can select the collection where to pick the offers to consider. 

You can, for example, create a "sport" collection that will contain sport-related offers only.

Collection creation is performed from the **[!UICONTROL Inventory]** tab. You can create a collection based either on selected offers, or on tags.

To create a collection by selecting offers, follow these steps:

1. Select one or several offers to move into the collection.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Create new collection by]** list, select the **[!UICONTROL Selected offers]** option.
