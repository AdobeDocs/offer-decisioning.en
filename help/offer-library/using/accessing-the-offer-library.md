## Main steps to create offers {#main-steps}

The main steps to create offers are as follows:

1. Create **placements**. Placements are a containers that will be used to showcase your offers. You can, for example, create a placement that will be dedicated to offers in the image format only, and situated to the top of your messages. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-placements.md).

1. Create **decision rules** that will specify the conditions under which the offers will be presented. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-decision-rules.md).

1. Create **tags** that you will associate to the offers, allowing you to easily organize and search them into the library. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-tags.md).

1. Create the **offers' content and properties**. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-personalized-offers.md).

1. Create **fallback offers**, which are the last resort offers to display if customers are not eligible for any of the selected offers. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-fallback-offers.md)

Once your offers have been created, you can deliver them  either through [APIs](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/decisioning-ode.yaml), or directly from [Adobe Campaign Standard](../../campaign-standard/using/overview.md).
