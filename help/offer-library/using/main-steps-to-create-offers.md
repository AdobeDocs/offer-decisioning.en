# Main steps to create and deliver offers {#main-steps}

The main steps to create and deliver offers are as follows:

![](assets/offers_process.png)

## Create offers in the Offer Library

1. Create **placements**. Placements are a containers that will be used to showcase your offers. You can, for example, create a placement that will be dedicated to offers in the image format only, and situated to the top of your messages. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-placements.md).

1. Create **decision rules** that will specify the conditions under which the offers will be presented. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-decision-rules.md).

1. Create **tags** that you will associate to the offers, allowing you to easily organize and search them into the library. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-tags.md).

1. Create the **offers' content and properties**. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-personalized-offers.md).

1. Create **fallback offers**, which are the last resort offers to display if customers are not eligible for any of the selected offers. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-fallback-offers.md)

## Deliver offers using [!DNL Adobe Campaign Standard]

1. Create an **email delivery**, then insert an **offer activity**.

1. Configure the activity according to your needs: specify the placement to use, the collections where to pick offers from, and the fallback offer.
