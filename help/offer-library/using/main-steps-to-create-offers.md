# Main steps to create an offer {#main-steps}

The main steps to create offers are as follows:

1. Create a **placement**. A placement is a container that will be used to showcase your offers. You can, for example, create a placement that will be dedicated to offers in the image format only, and situated to the top of your messages. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-placements.md).
1. Create a **decision rule** that will specify the conditions under which the offer will be presented. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-decision-rules.md).
1. Create **tags** that you will associate to the offer, allowing you to easily organize and search into the library. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-tags.md).
1. Create the **content** and **properties** of the personalized offer. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-personalized-offers.md).
1. Create a **fallback offer**, which is the last resort offer to display if a customer is not eligible for any of the offers selected. See [](../../offer-library/using/creating-fallback-offers.md)
