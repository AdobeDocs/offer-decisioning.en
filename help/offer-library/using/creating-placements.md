# Create placements {#creating-placements}

A placement helps ensure that the right offer content shows up in the right location within your message. When you add content to an offer, you will be asked to select a placement in which that content can be shown.

In the example below, there are three placements, corresponding to different types of content (image, text, HTML).

The list of placements is accessible in the **[!UICONTROL Placements]** tab. Filters are available to help you retrieve placements according to a specific channel or content.
