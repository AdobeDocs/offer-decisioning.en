# Key steps to create an offer {#key-steps}

The main steps to create offers are as follows:  

1. **Create placements**.
Placements are containers that will be used to showcase your offers. You can, for example, create a placement that will be dedicated to offers in the image format only, and situated to the top of your messages.

1. **Create decision rules** that will specify the conditions under which the offers will be presented.

1. **Create tags** that you will associate to the offers, allowing you to easily organize and search them into the library.

1. **Create the offers' content and properties**.

1. **Create fallback offers**, which are the last resort offers to display if customers are not eligible for any of the selected offers.
