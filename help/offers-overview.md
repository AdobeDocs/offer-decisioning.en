# Overview {#overview}

The Offers service provides offer creation, management, and decisioning, allowing you to continuously deliver the best offer to your customers. See [](../../sending/using/about-offer-management.md).

Before adding offer activities into your Campaign Standard messages, make sure that offers and fallback offers have been created in the Offer Library. See [](../../sending/using/creating-offers.md).

The main steps to add offers into emails are:

1. Insert an **offer activity** into an email structure component.
1. Select the **placement** that will contain the offer. This way, only offers with a content representation matching that placement are presented to the customer.
1. Select the **offers collection** to consider.
1. Select the **fallback offer** that will be presented if a profile is not eligible for any of the considered offers.
1. Visualize the **summary** of the offer activity, then confirm your selection.
1. **Send your email** with the selected offers.

These steps are detailed in these sections:

* [](../../sending/using/inserting-offer-activities.md)
* [](../../sending/using/configuring-offer-activities.md)
* [](../../sending/using/sending-emails-with-offer-activities.md)
