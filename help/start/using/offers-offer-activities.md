# Offers and offer activities {#offers-offer-activities}

An **Offer** is made up of content, eligibility rules and constraints that define the conditions under which it is presented to your customers.

It is created using the **Offer Library**, which is accessible directly from Adobe Experience Platform. It provides a central offer catalog where you can associate eligibility rules and constraints with multiple pieces of content to create and publish offers (see [](../../offer-library/using/accessing-the-offer-library.md)).

Once the Offer Library has been enriched with offers, [!DNL Adobe Campaign Standard] allows you to deliver them to your customers using **offer activities**.

These are specific components that are added into email deliveries and that will pick the best offer to deliver according to the target. For more on this, refer to [this section](../../campaign-standard/using/overview.md).
