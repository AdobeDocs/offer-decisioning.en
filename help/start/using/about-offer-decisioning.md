## About the Offer Decisioning service

Offer Decisioning provides offer creation, management, and decisioning, allowing you to continuously deliver the best offer and experience to your customers.

Benefits include:

* Improved e-mail campaign performance by delivering more personalized offers in your emails.
* Improved workflow: instead of creating multiple deliveries or campaigns, marketing teams can improve the workflow by creating a single delivery and vary the offers in different parts of the template.
* Enables you to create, manage, and approve offers outside of the Adobe Campaign Standard e-mail campaign workflow.
* Control over the number of times an offer is shown across e-mail campaigns and customers. 

## Requirements

In order to be able to use Offer Decisioning, you need to:

* Have your Campaign Standard instance hosted on Azure.
* Be provisioned with the Offer Decisioning service. For more on this, reach out to Adobe Customer Care or visit [Adobe Experience Cloud website](https://www.adobe.com/in/lead/experiencecloud/abx_nl_digital_foundation_cl.html).
