# About offers and offer activities {#about-offers-and-offer-activities}

## Offers

An Offer is made of content and eligibility rules and constraints that define the conditions under which it is presented to profiles.

The offer is created in the Offer Library, where you define its content for each placement in which it will be displayed, as well as its eligibility rules and constraints. See [](../../offer-library/using/accessing-the-offer-library.md).

Once the offer is created, you can use it directly within Campaign Standard offer activities to target profiles from your database. See [](../../campaign-standard/using/inserting-offer-activities.md).
