## Offer Decisioning service architecture

The Offer Decisioning application service consists in two main components:

* The **Centralized Offer Library** is the interface where you create and manage the different elements that compose your offers, and define their rules and constraints.
* The **Offer Decision Engine** leverages Adobe Experience Platform data and Real-time Customer profiles, along with the Offer Library, in order to select the right time, customers and channels to which offers will be delivered.

Benefits include:

* Improved campaign performance by delivering personalized offers across multiple channels,
* Improved workflows: instead of creating multiple deliveries or campaigns, marketing teams can improve workflows by creating a single delivery and vary the offers in different parts of the template,
* Control over the number of times an offer is shown across campaigns and customers.

## About offers and offer activities {#offers-offer-activities}

An **Offer** is made up of content, eligibility rules and constraints that define the conditions under which it is presented to your customers.

It is created using the **Offer Library**, which provides a central offer catalog where you can associate eligibility rules and constraints with multiple pieces of content to create and publish offers (see [Offer Library user interface](../../get-started/using/user-interface.md)).

Once the Offer Library has been enriched with offers, you can integrate your offers into **offer activities**.

Offer activities are containers for your offers that will leverage the Offer Decision Engine in order to pick the best offer to deliver depending on the target of the delivery.

## Common use cases

Offer Decisioning capabilities and integration with Adobe Experience Platform allow you to cover numerous use cases to help you increase customers' engagement and conversion.
