# Inserting offer activities into email deliveries {#xxxx}

To insert an offer activity into an email delivery, follow these steps:

1. Open a new delivery in the Email Designer. Global concepts on email creation are detailed in [Campaign Standard documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/designing-content/designing-content-in-adobe-campaign.html).

1. Select the component in the email that will contain the offer activity, or drag a new one from the left pane:

    * To insert an **image** offer, drag an image content component at the location of your choice in the email structure, then select it.

    * To insert a **text** or **HTML** offer, drag and drop a structure component into the location of your choice of the email structure, then click the **[!UICONTROL Select a column]** button to select the component's column.
