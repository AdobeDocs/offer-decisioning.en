# Configuring offer activities {#configuring-offer-activities}

Once an offer activity is added into a component, a dedicated menu displays in the left pane. See [](../../campaign-standard/using/inserting-offer-activities.md).

It allows you to configure the offer activity by selecting a placement, an offer collection, and a fallback offer.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the menu is not visible anymore, for example when clicking outside of the offer component, click the Offer button from the left pane to display it again.

To configure the offer activity, follow these steps:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Placements]** section, select the placement that will be used to present offers.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Make sure to select placements that are compatible with the component type selected in the email structure (text / HTML / image).

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Collections]** section, select the collection that contains the offers that you want to consider. For more on offers collections, see [](../../campaign-standard/using/managing-offer-collections.md).

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Fallback Offers]** section, select the fallback offer that will be presented to customers who are not eligible to the considered offers.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Summary]** tab to visualize the offers that are considered, and the selected fallback offer.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >At this step, all offers matching the selected placement are displayed. The decision rule that has been associated to the offer is not yet taken into account.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Done]** button to confirm the offer activity configuration.

Once created, you can still edit the offer activity settings or visualize the summary directly from the **[!UICONTROL Offer settings]** menu.
