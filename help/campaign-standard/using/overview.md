1. Select the **offers collection** to consider.
1. Select the **fallback offer** that will be presented if a profile is not eligible for any of the considered offers.
1. Visualize the **summary** of the offer activity, then confirm your selection.
1. Preview and proof your email.
1. **Send your email** with the selected offers.
