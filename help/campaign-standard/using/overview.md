# Overview {#overview}

Before adding offer activities into your Campaign Standard messages, make sure that offers and fallback offers have been created in the Offer Library. See [](../../start/using/main-steps-to-create-offers.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available for single-send and recurring email messages only. It is not available with transactional messages, push or SMS channels.

The main steps to add offers into emails are:

1. Select the email structure component where you want to insert an offer activity.
1. Select the **placement** that will contain the offer. This way, only offers with a content representation matching that placement are presented to the customer.
1. Select the **offers collection** to consider.
1. Select the **fallback offer** that will be presented if a profile is not eligible for any of the considered offers.
1. Visualize the **summary** of the offer activity, then confirm your selection.
1. Preview and proof your email.
1. **Send your email** with the selected offers.

These steps are detailed in these sections:

* [](../../campaign-standard/using/inserting-offer-activities.md)
