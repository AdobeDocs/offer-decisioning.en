# Sending emails with offer activites {#sending-emails-with-offer-activities}

Once an offer activity is inserted into a delivery, you can finalize and send it as usual. Global concepts on delivery sending are presented in [Campaign Standard documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/testing-and-sending/get-started-sending-messages.html).

Once the message has been sent, you can retrieve information on the offers that have been presented to the profiles in the delivery summary.

## Offer Summary {#offer-summary}

The **[!UICONTROL Offer Summary]** section provides information on the offers that have been presented to the targeted profiles for each placement.

* The **[!UICONTROL Proposition]** column indicates how many times an offer has been presented in a given placement. 

    In the example above, the "Offer_Discount" and "Offer_Upgrade" offers have been presented respectively to 700 and 300 profiles in the "Top Promotion" placement.

* The **[!UICONTROL Percentage]** column shows the proportion of offers presented for a given placement. 

    In this same example, the "Offer_Discount" offer represents 70% of the offers presented in the "Left Promotion" placement, versus 30% for the "Offer_Upgrade" offer.

## Sending logs {#sending-logs}

In the delivery **[!UICONTROL Sending logs]**, you can visualize the mirror page of the delivery, including the offers that have been presented.
