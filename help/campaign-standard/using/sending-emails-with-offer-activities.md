# Sending emails with offer activites {#sending-emails-with-offer-activities}

Once an offer activity is inserted into a delivery, you can finalize and send it as usual. Global concepts on delivery sending are presented in [Campaign Standard documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/testing-and-sending/get-started-sending-messages.html).

Once the message is sent, you can retrieve information on the offers that have been presented to the profiles.

* In the delivery summary, the **[!UICONTROL Offer Summary]** section provides information on offers that were presented with the email.

* In the delivery **[!UICONTROL Sending logs]**, you can visualize the mirror page of the delivery, including the offers that have been presented.
