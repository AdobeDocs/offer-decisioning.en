# Sending emails with offer activites {#sending-emails-with-offer-activities}

Once an offer activity is inserted into a delivery, you can finalize and send it as usual. Global concepts on delivery sending are presented in [Campaign Standard documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/testing-and-sending/get-started-sending-messages.html).

Once the message has been sent, you can retrieve information on the offers that have been presented to the profiles in the delivery summary.

The **[!UICONTROL Offer Summary]** section provides information on the offers that have been presented to the targeted profiles for each placement.

* The **[!UICONTROL Proposition]** column indicates how many times an offer has been presented in a given placement.

    In this example, the "running shoes" offer has been presented to 4 profiles in the "banner" placement. It has also been presented twice in the "email body" placement. On the other hand, the "boots" offer has been presented once, in the "banner" placement only.

* The **[!UICONTROL Percentage]** column shows the proportion of offers presented in a given placement. In this example, the "shoes" offer represents xx% of the offers presented in the banner placement.

In the example above, the "running shoes" offer representes 85% of the offers presented in the banner placements. on the other hand, it represents 100% of the offers presented in the email body placement.

## Sending logs

In the delivery **[!UICONTROL Sending logs]**, you can visualize the mirror page of the delivery, including the offers that have been presented.

## Dynamic reporting

Campaign Standard reporting capabilities allow you to build dynamic reports based on the sent offers.

To do this, a ready-to-use report is available (**[!UICONTROL Offer summary]**), as well as several **dimensions** and *metrics* related to offers to help you build your own dynamic reports.
